    <h1>He will know your ways as if born to them.</h1>
    <p>
      When I was younger, I had terrible impostor syndrome because whenever I
      tried to use Waterfall, like I was taught at school and college, my
      big-design-up-frontâ„¢ always deviated from what the customers actually
      wanted and their needs and the holes in my design slowly became obvious
      as the development went on. When I first heard about Agile, what I was
      actually being shown was Scrum and all the nonsense that Scrum puts on
      top of Agile obscures what it's actually about.
    </p>

      It's only in recent years that I've learned what Agile actually is, and
      it's the process that I wanted to employ back all those years ago when I
      had that impostor syndrome because my Waterfall was crap... Turns out,
      it's actually Waterfall itself that was being the impostor. It's a great
      pity that I spent 40 years chasing after it and it's only now that, as an
      aged old git, I can finally get around to doing things the way I wanted
      to back when I was a pongy little teenager.
