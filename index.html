                <p>
                    When I was younger, I had terrible impostor syndrome because
                    whenever I tried to use Waterfall, like I was taught at
                    school and college, my big-design-up-frontâ„¢ always deviated
                    from what the customers actually wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their needs and the holes in my design only slowly became
                    obvious as the development went on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I first heard about Agile, what I was actually being
                    shown was Scrum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And all the &quot;stuff&quot; that Scrum puts on top of
                    Agile obscures what it's actually about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's only in recent years that I've learned what Agile
                    actually is and it's the process that I wanted to employ
                    back all those years ago when I had that impostor syndrome
                    because my Waterfall was crap...
               </p>
               <p>
                   Turns out, it's actually Waterfall itself that was being the
                   impostor.
               </p>
               <p>
                   It's a great pity that I spent 40 years chasing after it and
                   it's only now that, as an aged old git, I can finally get
                   around to doing things the way I wanted to back when I was a
                   pongy little teenager.
