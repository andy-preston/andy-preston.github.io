<article><h1>Running GUI Apps in Docker as a non root user</h1>

<article><p>I Wanted to run The NSA's brilliant
<a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> without &quot;polluting&quot; my
system with a Java runtime.</p>

<p>There's a nice Docker image to do just that at
<a href="https://github.com/blacktop/docker-ghidra">blacktop/docker-ghidra</a>
but their docs seem to be a bit Mac. focussed and I had to jump through a few
extra hoops to get things working on Linux.</p>

<article>
<p>First, I used <code>xhost +</code> to allow X11 connections from anywhere.
This command isn't very selective and may even be unnecessary. Some more
experimentation is required.</p>

<p>Then I created a directory to be shared between the container and the host
and made sure it really was created. If left to the docker run command to
create it, it'll be owned by root and part of the point of all of this is to
not have files owned by root in my home directory.</p>

<p>Then we run blacktop's container, passing in my UID and GID to ensure I'm
the owner of any files we create in the shared directory.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I've used <code>--user</code> the programs in the container
don't care that this UID has no name within the container. But in the case of
Ghidra and/or Java, it did. So I pass in the host system's password and group
files as read only volumes. They will overwrite the files already in the
container's file system and in some cases may cause problems with users that
should exist in the container vanishing. But it worked for me this time
round.</p>

<p><code>--env DISPLAY=:0.0</code> was required to start Ghidra &amp;/or Java.
This was kinda odd as if it's not present Ghidra &amp;/or Java complains that
it can't write to display <code>:0.0</code>... and if you say don't use the
default (<code>:0.0</code>) use <code>:0.0</code> instead... everything works.
My head is still spinning on that one.</p>

<p>We also need <code>--net=host</code> so that Java will access the X11
display using it's host network address rather than Docker's virtual network.
(better explanation to follow).</p>
