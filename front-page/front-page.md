## Curate's Egg

I don't think it's fair (to blogs) to refer to this as a blog.

I had some snippets on GitHub that I wanted to document.

I had a few ideas that either niggle me at work or I think just might be useful
to someone else.

And you can't get through a job interview without them expecting you to have
some kind of presence online...

And what you see before you is a passing excuse for all of those things...

But not a lot else.

"Enjoy!" ;)

Marwood: "No, I wish I could. It's just thoughts really."
