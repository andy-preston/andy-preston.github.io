# Design Patterns and Computer Science

I've often had a bit of a gripe against "Computer Science"...
I've occasionally (often) thought "yeah... is it REALLY a science?"
Patterns are one of the things that ARE actually making it a science...
In "real" science one of the main things we do is look for patterns
and give them names: "Redox Reaction", "Spiral Galaxy", "Beta Decay",
"Evolution by Natural Selection".
With Patterns, Computer Science is starting, finally, to catch-up.
