# Your Favourite Language Sucks!

One of the most important books I've ever read is Douglas Crockford's
"JavaScript: The Good Parts" (O'Reilly Media, 2008) because it introduces
the concept that any language, not specifically JavaScript, can have
"Good Parts" and "Bad Parts" and most of them do.

We, as programmers, can have a terrible tendency towards "stamp collecting".
This can apply to the number of languages we seek to master, a desire to
(probably inappropriately) apply each and every design pattern that's
available, and (to get to my specific point here) to make use of all of the
features that our pet language has to offer.

And, as we're bringing up "Crockford, 2008" and favourite languages, we have to
talk about the endless debate (is it religion or politics? It's certainly not
science) of "my language is great but yours sucks". I quite enjoy working with
JavaScript, so I'm often on the receiving end of this tirade. But then again
circumstances have forced me into a life of servitude to PHP against my will and
so I, sadly, give as good as I get.
