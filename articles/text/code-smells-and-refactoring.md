# Code Smells and Refactoring

I was only looking for some decent JavaScript static analysis tools when I
stumbled across an absolutely superb article dealing with Code Smells and
Refactoring Patterns.

<https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells>

## The Language

The first thing that struck me about it was the language used. So many articles
on subjects like this use what seems like deliberately obtuse language
(looking at you Mr. Martin with your SOLID Principles). Others try so hard
to break down the barrier to entry that you quickly get bored with their
painstaking explanations of the patently obvious.

This article is neither of those things. It written with precision, it's some
of the most concise and clear technical writing I've ever seen. A delight to
read.

## Smells

The article takes each individual code smell and gives it a clear concise name
(the design pattern people would just love this) and describes the situations
where it could occur during normal development.

It then goes on to not only offer suggestions for refactoring but also, in many
cases, some reasons why it might not actually **be** a smell at all and why
it shouldn't be considered for refactoring.

## Refactoring

Each refactoring is then given a (excuse my repetition but this is part of my
delight in reading this article) clear a concise name and is accompanied by
not only what the payoffs might be but also what costs the refactoring could
incur.

## Style

The whole thing is also accompanied by (no offence intended) rather childish
cartoons which do a really good job of illustrating the points raised. And
aren't just there for decoration.

## Don't Just Take My Word For It

Have a read for yourself: <https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells> and see
what you think.

## Hang on, just one more rant before I go

So much software engineering content online tends to focus too strongly on
understanding the syntax and idioms of just one programming language.

Don't get me wrong, a world without [Matt Pocock](https://mattpocock.com/),
[Arjan Egges](https://arjancodes.com/) and
[Jacob Sorber](https://jacobsorber.com/) would be a darker place.

But material like this this is applicable across multiple languages and,
to some degree or another, multiple paradigms is truly golden and will stand
any programmer in good stead for years to come.
